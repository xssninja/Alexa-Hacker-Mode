This is a merging or of my project 0rion framework    www.0rion.tk
and Hacker Mode (xssninja/Alexa-Hacker-Mode)  https://github.com/xssninja/Alexa-Hacker-Mode

commands , names and responses may be slightly modified.

0rion runs on a debian 9 kali like server, the idea is to also merge all that is needed to for alexa to run from a private server with a 0rion server.
