Lambda may seem difficult if this is your first build,
Allow me to break this down into a few simple steps

Step1: create function
Step2: use a blueprint (( try page 8 (alexa-skill-kit-sdk-howtoskill)))
create new role
leave template form alone... didn't select shit
create
scroll down
delete file contents
copy and paste .js file  contents in its place 
save on the text editor
save up top
copy skill ID from alexa dev console side(found in endpoint )
add "alexa skills kit" to function
scroll down 
paste ID in place and add and save
copy lambda ID at top of screen
on alexa dev console go to endpoint and paste the lambda ID in the Default Region form and save endpoint
DONE!
